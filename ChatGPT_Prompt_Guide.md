## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific** - Include room dimensions, quantities, and specific fixtures/materials when you know them

2. **Ask follow-up questions** - If ChatGPT's suggestion doesn't quite fit, ask it to adjust

3. **Request ranges** - Ask for low/medium/high estimates if you're unsure about pricing

4. **Use local context** - Mention your area if labor rates vary significantly

5. **Double-check** - ChatGPT is a helper, not a replacement for your expertise. Always review its suggestions.

2. **Visit the site**, take measurements and photos
